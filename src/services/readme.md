## Purpose of `services`
Services handle our business logic.
Here 'business logic' means any task that is related to our task/business and not specific to the framework. The service is responsible for getting the work done and returning it to the controller. It contains the logic that is necessary to actually meet the requirements and return what the consumer is requesting.
